# music-search-extension
A Google Chrome extension that allows users to highlight text and search for music based on the selected text. 

# How It Works
When a user right clicks their highlighted text and then selects "Search For This Music", a window appears within the tab that displays music albums that contains the searched term. A user may click on any of the albums to listen to a 30 second song clip from that album. These results are grabbed from the Spotify API. The extension also has the ability to screen scrape the term's Wikipedia article (if it exists), and it will display the first section of that article within the extension's window.
